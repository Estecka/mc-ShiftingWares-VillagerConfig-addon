# Shifting-Wares: VillagerConfig Addon

Compatibility addon that enables ShiftingWares rerolls to use the custom trades and layouts defined by VillagerConfig.

## Caveats
- In order for Shifting Ware's map caching to work properly, **Exploration Map trades must use the same item-naming convention as vanilla trades.** Behaviour is undefined otherwise.
